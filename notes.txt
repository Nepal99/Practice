Print method in javascript
We are going to create the rest api’s in the node.js

Bootstraping angular application:

First we have to install the bootstrap
npm install bootstrap --save

we have to import the bootstrap also in the server.js like the usage of the static html

app.use('/modules', express.static('node_modules'));

when we are using the boostrap and referencing we have to give the same name is we aliased it in the server.js file.

eg: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">

install the angular dependency to the project by using the npm library.
eg: npm install angular --save
